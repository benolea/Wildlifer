# My Project

This is an ongoing iOS app project that shows outdoor activities near you.
For now, it is just a basic Google map view that shows parks in Texas using
the nps public api. As the project is ongoing will be adding more
features and more data all over the US.

## ScreenShot

Here is the App Screenshot:
